# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Create two clocks that siultaneously display and allow user to change time in either seconds, minutes, or hours.
Had to display a 12 hour clock and a 24 hour clock

# What did you do particularly well?

I was able to break up the code into several functions that made the main function very simple

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could impliment a section that would read current system time and make that the starting point for when the time was loaded

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found creating the display for the clocks the most challenging. I researched ways display repeating items and how to proparly implement them into my code
for what I needed 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Learning ways to break code into smaller peices have them work together to perform the task.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

by adding comments on what each function does also imlementing whitespace usage. This program could be adaptabed by adding a functiont that could implement new 
operations to the progam.
